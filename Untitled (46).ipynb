    "Q2. What are the advantages and limitations of using boosting techniques?\n",
    "ans-Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple weak models into a single strong model. The general idea behind boosting is to iteratively train weak models on the same dataset, with each iteration giving more weight to the misclassified samples in the previous iteration. The final model is a weighted combination of all the weak models, which gives higher accuracy than any individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Boosting Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved accuracy: Boosting can improve the accuracy of a model by combining multiple weak models into a single strong model. The final model is typically much more accurate than any individual weak model.\n",

    "Robustness: Boosting is known for its robustness to noise and outliers. It can effectively handle noisy data and outliers by giving more weight to the misclassified samples in each iteration.\n",

    "Sensitive to noise: While boosting is robust to noise and outliers, it can also be sensitive to them. In some cases, noise and outliers can cause overfitting and reduce the accuracy of the final model.\n",

    "Specifically, increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost:\n",
