    "Q1. What is Gradient Boosting Regression?\n",
    "ans-Gradient Boosting Regression is a popular machine learning technique for building predictive models that are based on decision trees. It is an extension of the gradient descent algorithm that is used for optimization problems, where the goal is to minimize a loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gradient Boosting Regression, a sequence of decision trees is trained in a stage-wise manner, with each tree correcting the errors made by the previous trees. The model is built by adding the predictions of each decision tree, weighted by a learning rate that controls the contribution of each tree to the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the model with a constant value (e.g., the mean of the target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fixed number of iterations (or until a convergence criterion is met), do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a decision tree on the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current model predictions. The negative gradient represents the direction of steepest descent, which is the direction that minimizes the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the optimal step size (i.e., learning rate) by minimizing the loss function along the line search direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the model by adding the predictions of the new decision tree, weighted by the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the process until the model converges or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regression can be used for both regression and classification tasks, with the loss function depending on the specific problem being addressed. The most commonly used loss functions for regression tasks are mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), while for classification tasks, the cross-entropy loss or exponential loss is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a powerful and flexible technique that can capture complex nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable. However, it can be sensitive to noisy data and overfitting, so careful tuning of the model parameters (such as the number of trees, the learning rate, and the depth of each tree) is necessary to obtain good performance.\n",
